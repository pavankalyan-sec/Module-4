# Exception Handling in Python: Avoiding Index Errors

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that handles an **IndexError** when trying to access an element beyond the available range of a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list `list1` with some integer elements.
2. Use a **try-except** block:
   - In the `try` block, attempt to access an index that is out of range (e.g., `list1[5]`).
   - In the `except` block, catch the error and print a custom message `"You're out of list range"`.
3. Print the result based on whether the index access succeeds or fails.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
~~~
list1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

try:
    out_of_bounds_element = list1[5]
    print(f"Successfully accessed element: {out_of_bounds_element}")
    result = "Success"

except IndexError:
    print("You're out of list range")
    result = "Failure"

print(f"Operation Result: {result}")
~~~

## Output

## Result
Thus the program has beeen executed successfully.
